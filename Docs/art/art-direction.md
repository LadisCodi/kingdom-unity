## 1. The anchor

In one line: **a bright stylized-3D diorama under a midday sun** — saturated
spring greens, cream stone, golden timber, blue and gold heraldry; rounded
chunky silhouettes; smooth simplified materials with no photographic texture;
every object readable at thumbnail size.

- Every asset is made against one style reference and matches the assets
  already made before inventing anything new.
- **The style is not pixel art, and nothing in the world is ever scaled with
  nearest-neighbour.**

## 2. Two cameras, one hand

| | **The city** | **The world board** |
|---|---|---|
| Camera | **isometric 2:1** (§3) | **a slight tilt** (§7.1) |
| The unit | a square cell, drawn as a diamond | a pointy-top hexagon |
| What it is for | *a diorama you look into* | *a map you read* |
| Palette | the same | the same |

- **One palette, one terrain set, one light.** The two scales differ in camera,
  never in colour: a single set of terrain art serves both.
- The world board's tilt is slight: rows stay straight and every hex is the
  same size, so hexes, distance, borders and ownership still count at a glance
  ([`../features/19-world-map.md`](../features/19-world-map.md) §1.2).
- What carries continuity between them is the palette, the light and the
  silhouettes — not the camera.

## 3. The isometric projection

**2:1, the mobile builder standard.** A cell's ground is a diamond **128 × 64**
world pixels at zoom 1.

```
screenX = (cell.x - cell.y) * 64
screenY = (cell.x + cell.y) * 32
```

- **No rounding drift and no seams** between neighbouring tiles at any zoom.
- **Draw order is `x + y` ascending** — the painter's algorithm. Tiles further
  from the camera are drawn first.
- **A sprite's anchor is the centre of its ground diamond**, not its own centre
  and not a corner.
- **Buildings rise; they never lean forward.** A sprite may overlap the tiles
  *behind* it (north), never the tiles *in front* (south). That is what keeps
  the painter's algorithm correct with no depth sorting inside a tile.

### 3.1 Canvas sizes

**A `w × h` plot's ground diamond is `(w+h)·64` wide and `(w+h)·32` tall** — it
is the span of the cells' screen positions plus half a tile each side, and it is
always 2:1. Canvas height is that diamond plus the footprint's headroom.

| Footprint | Ground diamond | Canvas | Anchor (from canvas top-left) | Headroom |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1 × 1** | 128 × 64 | **128 × 192** | (64, 160) | 128 |
| **2 × 1** | **192 × 96** | **192 × 224** | (96, 176) | 128 |
| **2 × 2** | 256 × 128 | **256 × 320** | (128, 256) | 192 |
| **3 × 3** | 384 × 192 | 384 × 448 | (192, 384) | 256 |

- The ground diamond always sits flush with the **bottom** of the canvas.
  Headroom is everything above it, and it is where the building stands.
- **Author at 2× and downscale** with a smooth filter. Never author at final
  size, and never upscale.

## 4. Terrain

- Six terrains, full-bleed and self-tiling, one diamond each: **Grassland,
  Plains, Desert, Snow, Tundra, Water**.
- A terrain tile is **quiet**. It is the floor everything else stands on, it is
  seen a thousand times a session, and anything eye-catching in it competes with
  the things that matter. Variation belongs in features, not in the ground.
- **No visible grid lines.** The diamond's edge reads from the terrain's own
  softly rounded, raised diorama edge.
- Water is the one exception to the quiet rule: clear cyan, gently animated.

## 5. Buildings

- **Silhouette first.** A building is identified at thumbnail size by its
  outline, before any detail resolves. If two buildings share a silhouette, one
  of them is wrong.
- Compact proportions with **slightly oversized roofs, doors, windows and the
  feature that says what the building does** — the mill's wheel, the barracks'
  banner, the sanctum's crystal.
- **Levels read as growth, not as replacement.** A building's levels keep its
  silhouette and its palette and add mass, storeys and props. A player should
  never have to re-learn a building because it levelled.
- **A level draws the highest art tier at or below it**, so levelled art can
  land one tier at a time.
- **A building stands on the terrain, not on a plate**: no ground block of turf
  or soil under it, and every prop inside its own plot.
- **Small decorative details, used sparingly.** Tidy vegetation, clustered
  rounded canopies, no clutter.

## 6. Units and characters

- Units are **gameplay-scale figures integrated into the environment**. They
  never pose, never face the camera, and are never the subject.
- **A villager stands ~48 px tall** on a 128 × 64 tile — about a third of a 1×1
  building's headroom. Big enough to read as a person, small enough that the
  city reads as a city.
- **A portrait is a face; a unit is a silhouette.** Portraits follow their own
  discipline.
- Walk cycles are 4 frames, work loops 2.

## 7. The hex board

- **Pointy-top hexagons, a slight tilt** (§7.1).
- Two zoom registers ([`../features/19-world-map.md`](../features/19-world-map.md)
  §1.2), one asset set serving both:

| Register | Hex width on screen | Its job |
|---|---|---|
| Tactical | ~130 pt | look at a place |
| Strategic | ~45 pt | count hexes and plan |

- **Author at the tactical size and downscale.** A hex asset is **256 px wide ×
  296 px tall** (pointy-top: height = width × 2/√3), authored at 2×.
- **A hex is a terrain plate plus one sprite for its combination** of
  terrain and features — a forested mountain is one drawing, not a mountain
  beside some trees. Only the combinations that occur get art.
- **An improvement's art includes the feature it works** (the Logging Camp
  among its trees); what it does not work stays drawn behind it.
- **Three or four content elements read comfortably on a tactical hex.** Past
  that, the hex is overloaded and something must be dropped or merged.
- Ownership reads as a **border colour on the hex edge**, never as a tint over
  the ground — a tinted hex fights the terrain it is meant to identify. It is
  painted on the ground: over the plate, under everything that stands on the
  hex.

### 7.1 The tilt

- **The ground is squashed to 72 % top to bottom** — the board seen from a
  little south of overhead. No vanishing point: a far hex is as big as a near
  one.
- **Only the ground tilts.** Terrain plates, hex edges, borders, rims and
  route rings are squashed; castles, trees, mountains, buildings and figures
  stand upright, their foot on the squashed ground.
- **A tile has thickness**: a side 16 % of the hex's radius deep under its two
  lower edges, the right face in shade, packed earth. Only revealed and sensed
  hexes are tiles; an Unknown hex is the cloud bank (§8.1).
- The row in front hides that side, and the clouds hide it where explored
  ground meets them: the board stands in the clouds, never floats on them.
- **Hex art is authored flat** (256 × 296) and squashed when drawn.

## 8. States the map has to show

Every one of these is a treatment of the same asset, never a second asset.

| State | Treatment |
|---|---|
| **Undiscovered** | the cloud bank (§8.1); the hex or cell is not there |
| **Discovered / Sensed** | under low mist, desaturated (§8.1); silhouettes rise out of the clouds — on the world board, a thin veil of the bank's clouds |
| **Revealed** | full colour, the default |
| **Exhausted** (a harvest cell) | the same tile, spent — stumps, bare soil, still clearly the same place |
| **Under construction** | scaffold and a pit, at the building's own footprint |
| **Selected / valid target** | a warm rim on the diamond's edge, never a fill; painted on the ground, under what stands there |
| **Inactive** (a world hex off the chain) | greyed toward the Sensed treatment, buildings intact |

- **Unexplored ground is under a sunlit sea of clouds — and still the same
  stylized world.** It is never dark, and never a flat grey void.

### 8.1 The fog: a sea of clouds

The fog that swallowed the kingdom is a bright sea of clouds lying on the
province under the midday sun.

| Fog state ([`../features/01-map-and-fog.md`](../features/01-map-and-fog.md) §4) | Drawn as |
|---|---|
| **Revealed** | full colour — the only coloured ground on screen |
| **Discovered, payable** | a thin see-through veil, ankle-high: terrain desaturated with a pale sheen, tree crowns standing out of it almost whole |
| **Discovered, not payable** | a low cushion of cloud, almost opaque: terrain hidden, only the tips of tall things poking out |
| **Undiscovered** | the cloud bank: one seamless field of sculpted cumulus filling everything, off the map's edge too; toward a seen cell only the tallest puffs remain, so its edge is the outline of the clouds, inside the fogged cell |

- **The clouds are a stylized material**, like the tree canopies: chunky,
  softly bevelled, three flat tones and a clean edge — never photographic,
  wispy, grey or gloomy.

| Tone | Value |
|---|---|
| Cloud top, sunlit | `#EAE2EB` |
| Cloud mid | `#BCC2F7` |
| Cloud shadow | `#ABB5F3` |
| The not-payable cushion | `#DFD8EB` |

- **One cushion a cell.** Every fogged cell carries its own mist on its own
  diamond, dipping a little at the edges, so the grid reads from the dips and
  no line is drawn.
- **Density is height.** The veil, then the cushion, then the bank: the fog
  rises step by step away from the cleared ground.
- **A sighted thing rises out of the cloud tops**
  ([`../features/01-map-and-fog.md`](../features/01-map-and-fog.md) §4.1) as a
  flat, pale shape in the cloud-shadow tone, hazy at its foot: something
  stands there, not what.
- **A treasure's chest and an abandoned building's ruin** show through the
  veil as themselves, desaturated with the ground.
- **A tap tears the cushion**: each of the five takes a fifth of the mist off
  the cell, torn from the middle, with curling wisps lifting away.
- **A reveal blows it away**: the last wisps lift and fade in under a second,
  and the colour floods back into the cell from its centre.
- **The bank drifts**: the whole field slides slowly across the province,
  one texture repeat every ten minutes, with a slow boil over it; it never
  covers a cell the player can see.
- **The world board stands in the same bank**: every Unknown hex and
  everything past the board's edge, at full thickness up to every seen hex.
  The tallest puffs lap over a seen hex's edges — a fifth of a hex over its
  two near edges, a tenth over its two far ones.
- **A Sensed hex is under a thin veil** of the same clouds, drifting with
  the bank: the terrain shows through, pale; it spills a little onto clear
  ground beside it. What stands on it rises out as a silhouette in the
  cloud-shadow tone, palest at its foot.
- **A reveal lifts the clouds** over about a second: the bank thins to a
  veil, its tallest puffs last, and the veil lifts.
- **Cloud shadows** — the texture at far larger scale — drift slowly over
  seen ground the other way.
- **Far out, the puffs grow**: past 75 % zoom the texture at twice the size
  takes over, so the bank never becomes a busy speckle.
- **Layers, bottom to top:** plates and sides; the bank, the veil and the
  shadows; the rims on the hex edges (ownership, selection); everything that
  stands on a hex; every other mark on the board.
- **A tap on a hex answers at once**: a brief warm flash on it, its rim
  swelling, before the sheet is read.
- **An explorer's route fades as it goes into the bank.**
- **Art:** the bank is one tileable texture; the cushion and the payable
  patch are sprites.
- **What is drawn over the fog stays over it**: the reach line, the lair's
  ground, the progress bar of a tap.

## 9. The dials, in the order to reach for them

| Dial | Moves | Reach for it when |
|---|---|---|
| **Tile diamond** (128 × 64) | everything | never, in practice — this is the one number everything else is derived from |
| **Headroom per footprint** (§3.1) | how much a building towers | buildings hide each other, or look squat |
| **Villager height** (48 px) | whether the city reads as a city | people vanish, or dominate |
| **Hex width** (256 px authored) | how much a hex can hold | content stops fitting at the tactical size |
| **Board tilt** (72 %) | how much depth the board has | the board reads flat, or distance stops reading |
| **Tile thickness** (16 % of the radius) | how solid a tile feels | the rim looks like a wall, or not at all |
| **Terrain busyness** | how much the ground competes | the map feels noisy and nothing pops |

## 10. Deliberately not in this design

- **Pixel art** and **nearest-neighbour scaling**, anywhere in the world.
- **A top-down camera** that shows the top face of everything.
- **A second palette for the world board** (§2).
- **A dark fog of war**, and weather: no cloud moves across the map, and the
  fog has no night.
- **Perspective on the hex board** — a vanishing point, far hexes smaller
  (§7.1).
- **Visible grid lines** on the city ground (§4).
- **Loose props laid out side by side** on a hex (§7).
- **Chrome.** It is specified elsewhere and this document does not touch it.
