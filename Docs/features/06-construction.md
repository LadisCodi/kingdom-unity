# 6 · Construction — builders, and the offer a refusal raises

> **Scope.** How many things the city can build at once, what happens when it
> cannot build one more, and the builder purchase surface.
>
> **Status: built.**

## 1. The rule

- There is no waiting line. A build starts if a builder is free; otherwise it is
  refused.
- Jobs in flight = builder count.
- An upgrade, or the repair of an abandoned building
  ([`01-map-and-fog.md`](01-map-and-fog.md) §6.3), occupies a builder exactly
  as a build does.
- **A job at work shows on the map** as it does on the card: the working
  hammer flies over the building, and the blue glass bar on its plot holds
  the time left.
- **A build cannot be cancelled.** It is paid for when it starts, and a
  building put in the wrong place is moved rather than undone
  ([`05-city-and-districts.md`](05-city-and-districts.md) §4.2) — which is why
  a move works on an unfinished building.

## 2. The offer

- A build or upgrade refused for want of a builder opens a sheet. No toast.
  The same holds on the world map: a claim or a world build refused for want
  of a builder opens the same sheet.
- Two states, one sheet:

| State | Shows |
|---|---|
| Below the ceiling | every busy builder's job with its time left and a Gem **Finish**, and a Gem **Hire** in the next empty slot. A builder out on the world map shows its job and time left, with no Finish |
| **At** the ceiling | the same, and **no hire** |

- Placement mode stays open behind the sheet. Dismissing it returns the player
  to the positioned ghost.
- A job that ends while the sheet is open — on its own or by Finish — turns
  its builder's row into the job the sheet was raised for: the Build for the
  positioned ghost, or the claim or world build that was refused.

## 3. The price

- `round(base × growth^purchased)`: the same escalating-slot curve as the
  hero slots.
- `purchased` is **derived**, `builders − startBuilders`, not stored. A
  *granted* builder (a quest, an event) makes the next *bought* one dearer.
- Every Gem sink is priced on the 500-Gems-a-dollar ladder
  ([`14-monetization.md`](14-monetization.md) §2.2). Each builder is the next
  pack up (`×2`).
- The up-front Gem faucet is 1,250 Gems: 500 to start, 750 across the quest
  chain ([`14-monetization.md`](14-monetization.md) §1.1).

| Builder | Gems | Pack |
|---|---|---|
| 2nd | **2,500** | $4.99 |
| 3rd | 5,000 | $9.99 |
| 4th | 10,000 | $19.99 |

- A builder unlocks nothing; it lets two things happen at once.

## 4. Dials, in the order to reach for them

| Dial | Value | Key |
|---|---|---|
| Builders at the start | 1 | `kingdom.startBuilders` |
| Ceiling | 4 | `kingdom.maxBuilders` |
| Price of the next builder | `round(2500 × 2^purchased)` | `kingdom.builderGemCostBase`, `…Growth` |

## 5. Deliberately not in this design

- A waiting line, and any promotion or reordering logic (§1).
- A `buildQueueCapacity` dial alongside the builder count.
- A free trial of a builder.
- A store card for builders ([`14-monetization.md`](14-monetization.md) §2).
- Cancelling a build, and the refund that went with it (§1).
