# 11a · Ruins — screens

> **Spec.** Systems: [`11-expeditions.md`](11-expeditions.md). Fight screen:
> [`combat.md`](combat.md). Map marker and fog:
> [`01-map-and-fog.md`](01-map-and-fog.md). Guild and reservoir are owned
> elsewhere; this document specifies only what ruins add to them.
>
> **Status: partly built.** The battle screen (§2.5–2.6) serves a lair's
> attack and an army leaving for the world board; the playback (§2.7) serves
> every fight. A dungeon room is fought from the camped army's sheet on the
> world board (*Delve*), straight into the playback. Not built: the map marker,
> discovery card, ruin sheet, room ladder, the room's widget, the Guild preview
> and the reservoir meter.

## 2. Screens

### 2.1 Map marker

| | |
|---|---|
| Data | Ruin name, tier, affinity, rooms cleared / total, `has_available_room`, `has_new_unlock` |
| Elements | Marker art per tier, progress ring or `12/30`, badge |
| Rules | Tap opens the ruin sheet with no confirmation. Badge shows when a room is enterable and unattempted since last visit |

### 2.2 Discovery card

| | |
|---|---|
| Data | Ruin name, tier, affinity, flavour line, Depth 1 room count |
| Elements | Full-bleed art, `Enter`, `Later` |
| Rules | Fires once on fog lift. Queues behind other reveals. Never blocks input |

### 2.3 Ruin sheet — depth stack

| | |
|---|---|
| Data per ruin | Name, tier, affinity, total progress |
| Data per depth | `depth_index`, name, `rooms`, rooms cleared, `guildReq`, boss name + art + chest contents, `passiveOnComplete` |
| Data for the gate | creature + type, raid countdown, trips left, hoard ([`18-garrisons-and-raids.md`](18-garrisons-and-raids.md) §7) — while it stands |
| Elements | Vertical stack, deepest at bottom; the gate band above Depth 1 while it stands; one band per depth showing `7/12`; boss card at the end of each band with reward art |
| States | Gated · locked · open · in progress · complete · bottomed out |
| Rules | While the gate stands every depth reads gated and only the gate band is tappable. Locked depths display `guildReq` and their boss reward. Bottomed out is a distinct visual from locked. Tapping an in-progress band opens the frontier room |

### 2.4 Room ladder

| | |
|---|---|
| Data per room | `room_index`, `power_req`, threat type (Scout only), reward preview, cleared flag, is-boss |
| Elements | One card per room; cleared dimmed + ticked; frontier highlighted; locked rooms flat. Next-carrot banner pinned above the frontier |
| Banner | Two variants — next overridden reward row, next boss. Boss wins when closer. Format: *"5 rooms → the Hollowed Crown, +12 Stardust/h"* |
| Rules | Auto-scroll to frontier on open |

### 2.5 Room sheet — the battle screen

Used by a lair's attack ([`18-garrisons-and-raids.md`](18-garrisons-and-raids.md))
and by an army sent onto the world board. One screen serves every fight, and
what differs between two fights is **the widget at the top** and the bands
under the board.

| | |
|---|---|
| Data | Battle name and place, a **dynamic band** for whatever this kind of fight has to say, the enemy squads and their power, the party's slots and its attack, supply cost, reward preview |
| Elements | Two army boxes of the same shape — theirs cold, ours warm — each with its power on the right; the party's slots; the reward chips; one primary button |
| Height | The sheet takes the **whole frame**, whatever is on it. The spare height goes to the two army boxes, so the slots are the size of the barracks picker and the button never moves as the party changes |
| States | Party over power · party under power (the box warns, the button still goes) · supplies unaffordable (the button blocks) |
| Rules | A power shortfall **warns, never blocks**. **The enemy squads are what the fight is scored against** — the formation is derived from the authored budget and the budget is not shown. **The screen carries no prose that restates its own numbers**: the two armies' faces and their two power figures are the comparison, and the only way out is the sheet's own knob |

**What each fight puts in the widget:**

| Fight | The widget carries |
|---|---|
| **A gate** | the raid countdown, trips left, the hoard |
| **A room** | the address (`Depth 2 · Room 5`), **two progress bars**, and the boss's chest at the end of the depth |

**The room's two bars.** One for the **depth**, one for the **room inside it**,
with a **skull at the end of the room bar** — the boss of this depth, dim until
the player is standing at it.

- The **fill is what is behind them** and the **label is where they are**:
  room 1 of 8 with nothing cleared is an empty bar, and should be.
- Nothing else counts rooms.

- A room's enemy box is sized from that room's `power_req` and typed by the
  ruin's **bias**: what a room drew is not shown until the Guild's scouting
  buys it, so the box says *mostly*, never *is*.
- **No band under the board.** A relic is never on a board or in a ruin
  ([`09-relics.md`](09-relics.md) §1), and there is nothing else a room decides
  that is not a slot.
- There is no "how far will you go" control: one room, one fight, resolved on
  the tap ([`11-expeditions.md`](11-expeditions.md) §5). The button reads
  *Enter the room*, or *Fight the boss* on the last room of a depth.

### 2.6 Party composition — slots and panels

Two rows of slots on the battle screen, filled from the roster under them.

| | |
|---|---|
| Data | Troop slots and hero slots — open, filled or **locked**; the roster behind each panel; party attack, live |
| Flow | Tap a troop tile in the roster → **the next free troop slot fills**. Tap a hero slot → the hero picker. *Quick deploy* (on a lair) fills the board: the best heroes that can fight, then squad after squad, best answer to the lair first |
| Fill rule | A card sends **as much as it legally can**: a whole squad (`squadSize`), or everything left of that type, or everything the army cap still allows |
| Clearing | A tap on a filled troop slot sends that squad home |
| Locked slots | **Hero slots only** — a padlock, and the Gem price on the one a purchase would open. Every troop slot is open from the first fight; nothing gates one and nothing sells one |
| Roster | One tile per troop type: its bust, how many are left at home, its name. A tile that can send nothing says why when tapped |

### 2.7 The fight — the playback

Full screen, over the navigation and under only the gacha reveal: a fight the
player can tap around is not a fight.

**The fight is already over when this opens.** The resolver ran on the tap,
the rewards are banked and the fallen are off the roster — this replays the
event stream ([`combat.md`](combat.md) §13) at the tick it was written in, so
an interrupted replay costs nothing.

| | |
|---|---|
| Data | The log, and nothing else: the two boards from its `start`, then every `attack`, `troops_lost` and `slot_wiped` in order |
| Elements | **The power bar** at the top — two totals and one split fill, falling as squads come apart (§12). **Six rows of slots**: their heroes · their back · their front · *a gap* · our front · our back · our heroes. The back rank draws smaller, because the row is what decides who gets hit. **Each slot's ring is its health** — leaf for ours, clay for theirs — emptying round the dial; what a blow just took stays pale for a beat |
| Ground | The board stands on the ground of its kind of fight, seen from above and quiet in the middle: the **field** outside a lair, a **dungeon** room, a depth's **boss** hall, the **Portal**'s depths |
| Opening | The replay holds **0.8 s** while each side's rows slide in from its own edge, front rank first, the crossed swords on the bar clash and the place's plaque swings down on its rope, the knobs after it |
| Swing | The attacker moves first, timed so the blow lands **on the tick the log wrote**. Melee lunges at its target (Cavalry further, raising dust); a shooter draws back and looses — an arrow per troop line (up to three), a bolt for a hero — and it lands on the tick |
| Hit | The target flashes, flinches away from the blow and a hit sound plays. A blade's mark crosses it — a slash, a straight thrust for Lancers — with sparks; an arrow throws sparks only. The weight of all of it scales with the share of the slot's health the blow took |
| Numbers | Each blow's damage rises off the target. **Blows on one slot within ¼ s add up into one number that grows**; never more than six in the air. Advantage on the type chart = larger, amber; disadvantage = smaller, dull; a heal = leaf `+N`; what a shield soaked = sky `(N)` |
| Skills | A timed skill **charges** 0.32 s before it lands: its caster glows in the skill's tint and a **ribbon** of dyed cloth unrolls across the line between the armies with the skill's name — one at a time, the newest replacing it. Then it is cast to land on its tick: **Volley** rains arrows on every target · **Cleave** and **Crush** lunge at the targets, Crush with a ring of air, a shaken board and a hold · **Ambush** crosses the board to the target and back · **Sharpshot** is a line of light · **Mend**, **Wave**, **Shield**, **Daze** throw a bolt of their tint (Wave also a ring from its caster); a heal raises lights off its target. **Rallies** are named one by one after the armies march on, and every slot of their side flares in the rally's colour |
| Shield | A bubble round the slot **for as long as the shield lasts**; it wobbles when it soaks a blow and shatters when it is spent |
| Daze | The slot dims and three stars circle over it for the daze's length |
| Weight | A heavy blow with the advantage (≥ 8% of the slot) and a squad going down **hold the replay** for a beat (70 · 110 ms), never two within half a second of the fight |
| Death | The slot shakes, its ring **cracks** — grooves run in from the rim — and bursts into chips (wood; gold for a hero), the portrait desaturates and a skull is **stamped** on it with a thud; a hero's portrait slumps in its broken ring. A death sound plays. The troop count pops red on every loss, and a helmet or two tumbles off the ring |
| Power bar | Its two numbers **roll down** to what is left; a loss worth ≥ 4% of a side's opening power jolts the bar and pops that side's number |
| Sound | Its own tune under the fight, giving way at the plaque. Every blow sounds by who struck it (sword · lance · hooves-and-armour · arrow), an archer's release and a cavalry line's gallop before it; a ring cracking, its skull landing, a hero falling; a skill's charge, its ribbon and its own sound; each rally its call; the slow last blow; a fanfare for *Victory*, a lament for *Defeat*. Frequent sounds are voice-limited so a dozen blows a second never become a roar |
| Haptics | Where the device vibrates: a short buzz on a heavy blow, a longer one on a wipe, a pattern on the verdict; never two within 120 ms, and none under reduced motion |
| Reduced motion | No opening, swings, flinches, effects, holds, slow motion or flash; the plaque and the skull appear without moving. The ring, the numbers and the cracks stay |
| Ending | A fight won by a wipe plays its **last 0.3 s at 0.3×** and ends on a white flash. **0.6 s** later the plaque lands over the middle of the board: *Victory* drops in and bounces in a burst of gold; *Defeat* lands heavy and askew, cracked, and the field goes grey under it |
| Rewards | On a victory with spoils, the **gacha reveal** deals them over the board — the one screen that already knows how to hand things over one at a time (§8.3 of [`10-heroes.md`](10-heroes.md)) |
| Leaving | Then, and only then, a button at the bottom. It returns to the room sheet, which is already showing the NEXT room |
| Rules | Two controls under the bar: **speed** — ×1, ×2, ×4 in turn, kept for the next fight — and **Skip** (straight to the result). At ×1 one tick is 100 ms, so the replay is as long as the fight was |

### 2.8 Result — the sheet behind it

There is no separate result screen. The room sheet is still standing when the
playback closes, showing the next room, the survivors already in its slots and
the same numbers it always shows — which is the diagnosis a beaten player
needs (*their power against yours*) without a screen of its own.

### 2.9 Guild screen — unlock preview

Owned by [`buildings.md`](buildings.md).

| | |
|---|---|
| Data | Current level, next level cost, depths the next level opens (ruin + depth + boss name + art), other level rewards |
| Elements | *"Guild 5 → Ironworks D3 · Counting House D2"* with both boss cards |
| Also hosts | Ruins index: every discovered ruin, its progress, what it waits on |

### 2.10 Reservoir meter

Owned by the city economy.

| | |
|---|---|
| Data | Accrued Stardust / XP / Gold, cap (2 h), time to cap, capped flag |
| Rules | One meter for the whole idle economy. Distinct full state, visible from the city HUD |

## 3. Cross-cutting

- **Badge priority**, one order across map marker, Guild button and city HUD:
  reservoir full > new unlock > room available.
- **Number formatting** for Stardust and XP in the thousands.
- **Empty states**: no ruin discovered; all open depths cleared with the Guild
  unaffordable.
- **Currency copy**: one line each for XP, Stardust, fragments.
- **Localisation**: 5 ruin names, ~20 depth names, 15 boss names.

## 4. Build order

1. Ruin sheet · room ladder · room sheet · both result screens — one milestone,
   nothing is playable until all five exist.
2. Guild unlock preview.
3. Discovery card, badging, ruins index.

**Prototype cut:** step 1 only, placeholder art, simplified battle view.

**Long-lead art:** 15 boss cards, 5 ruin markers, 5 discovery illustrations,
affinity and threat icons.

## 5. Mockup prompts

For image generation in ChatGPT. Paste the style block first, then one screen
prompt per image. Keep labels short — rendered text will be imperfect and is
placeholder only.

### 5.1 Style block (prepend to every prompt)

```

### 5.4 Room sheet — pre-fight

```
Screen: pre-battle preparation panel for a single dungeon room.

strength value.
Middle: the hero focus — a large power comparison element showing two numbers
facing each other, the player's on the left in gold, the enemy's on the right
in red, with a subtle warning glow because the player's is lower.
Below: a horizontal party strip of four portrait slots, three filled with
armoured unit portraits and one empty with a plus icon.

Below: a slim progress row showing a passive-income counter with a small
upward arrow and a cyan crystal icon.
Bottom: two buttons, a large gold primary and a smaller flat secondary.
No confetti, restrained celebration, cozy not explosive.
```

### 5.6 Result — failed

```
Screen: post-defeat information panel, calm and informative rather than harsh.
Muted palette, cool slate-blue, no red alarm styling, no skulls.
Top: a short heading and a small dimmed monster portrait.

the player's lower value on the left and the enemy's on the right, with a
small explanatory line beneath and two matchup icons showing a cavalry icon
beating an archer icon.
Below: a spent-cost row with a wheat icon.
Bottom: three buttons stacked — one gold primary, two flat secondary.
```

### 5.7 Discovery card

```
Screen: a full-bleed discovery reveal card. Painted illustration of a sunken
overgrown stone ruin entrance at dusk, mist and fireflies, cozy and
inviting rather than horror.

Vignette edges, soft depth of field.
```

progress bar.
```

### 5.9 Map marker

```
Close crop of an illustrated overworld map tile in a cozy kingdom builder,
top-down slightly angled painted style, grass, trees and stone paths.
Center: a ruin entrance marker — a small painted stone archway on a raised
base, with a circular progress ring around it in gold, a tiny affinity icon
on the ring, and a small glowing notification badge at its upper right.
Nearby: two dimmer markers partially covered by soft grey fog at the frame
edges.
No UI panels, no text beyond the badge.
```
