## 1. The Gold sinks it sits beside

Every other Gold sink is one-time ([`03-economy.md`](03-economy.md) §7):

| Sink | Total | Ceiling |
|---|---|---|
| Landmark claims | **537,000 Gold** | eleven landmarks; 2,000 · 10,000 · 25,000 ×5 · 100,000 ×4 |
| The whole map's fog | **2,522,803,392 Gold** | a last cell |
| The technology tree, 167 technologies | **592,385 Gold** | a last node |
| Buildings and their levels | on a curve | `maxCountPerTownhallLevel`, and `maxLevel` on every district |
| | **≈ 2,524,000,000 Gold** | nothing after it |

- A Wonder is the upgrade ladder with `maxLevel` removed, standing on the map.

## 2. What a Wonder is

**A district you place, whose level ladder is a curve rather than a table.**

| | How it expresses a level | Can it be infinite? |
|---|---|---|
| a building | tables — `maxLevel`, `populationCapacityPerLevel`, `maxWorkersPerLevel`, `influenceRadiusPerLevel`, `requiredTownhallLevelPerLevel`, `requiredTechPerLevel`, `armyCapPerLevel`, all indexed by level | no — a table has a last row |
| a Wonder | formulas — `costBase`, `costGrowth`, `effectPerLevel` (§6) | yes — nothing stops it |

- From the district: placement, footprint, art, being a thing on the map.
- From a formula: the ladder. Level `L` costs `round(costBase × costGrowth^L)`
  Gold and is worth `effectPerLevel × L`.
- **No per-level table anywhere in a Wonder's definition.**
- Adding Wonders is additive — new `buildings` entries.

### 2.1 The shell test

A Wonder is a shell around existing systems (**OQ-6**):

- No currency of its own — Gold.
- No screen of its own — tap it, the district card opens.
- No economy of its own — one number per level, resolved by the helper that
  already owns that number.
- If a Wonder ever needs a second currency or its own menu, it is cut.

## 3. Two rules

Both are structural, not numerical.

### 3.1 A Wonder's effect is never denominated in Gold

- A Wonder that raises `taxRate` is forbidden.
- A production Wonder pays materials, and nothing in the city turns materials
  back into Gold — so there is no loop to close at all.

### 3.2 One of each; the level is the only ladder

- Hard count cap of **one, ever** — not one per Townhall level.
- Per-level cost restarts at zero for a new copy of a building, so a second
  copy would beat one deep Wonder at every level.
- Invariant: **a Wonder's level is the only way to buy more of its effect.**
  No second copy, no alternative scaling source of the same stat, no bundle.
- There is exactly one Everspring in the world; it is a landmark of the
  player's own city (art: **OQ-57**), and its level is the number on the card
  (§9).

## 4. A level is instant on payment

- A Wonder level does not go through the build queue. It is bought like an
  upgrade and lands the moment it is paid.
- No builder is occupied. `upgradeDuration` and `upgradeDurationLevelGrowth`
  do not apply. This keeps the second-builder offer and the *no waiting
  line* rule of [`06`](06-construction.md) intact.
- No boundary in the offline replay: nothing scheduled, nothing expiring.
- A Wonder level is a purchase, not a construction.
- No anticipation beat: no progress bar, nothing to come back for. The pull is
  the next level's visible price (§9).

## 5. The prototype set

Three Wonders. Each effect is a stat that already exists.

| Wonder | Stat | A level buys |
|---|---|---|
| **The Everspring** | `cellRecovery` | the ground regrows faster — the reward-side exit for map density (**OQ-54**) |
| **The Astral Spire** | `manaRegen` | more Mana per hour — more taps |
| **The Bell of Toil** | `workerYield` | the crew strikes harder |

Not in the set:

- A Gold Wonder (§3.1).
- A fog-discount Wonder — the Pitons ladder already does that (**OQ-23**).
- A combat Wonder — the army cap is a city-building decision
  ([`combat.md`](combat.md) §14).
- A build-speed Wonder — `buildSpeed` is a modifier stat already.

Names are a first pass, under the same standing offer as the tome titles
(**OQ-15**).

### 5.1 The building

| | |
|---|---|
| **Houses** | nobody |
| **Employs** | nobody — no crew, no claims, no travel |
| **Area of influence** | none |
| **Footprint** | large — the ground is the permanent half of the price (§8) |
| **Movable** | yes — promise 1 |
| **Count** | one (§3.2) |
| **Destroyed or downgraded** | never — promise 1 |

- A Wonder produces nothing and stores nothing.
- It acts only as a term in another helper's formula (§7).

### 5.2 Unlock gate

- The gate is the Townhall's final level, as for every other district.
- While any one-time sink (§1) is unbought a Wonder is the wrong purchase; the
  gate keeps it out of the build menu until then.
- A Wonder is late-game content; a player who does not reach the last era
  never meets it.

### 5.3 Cosmetic tiers

- The building's art changes every N levels, computed as `L % N`, never from a
  table.
- Tiers have zero economic effect (§3.1).
- This is also the cosmetic probe **OQ-26** asks for.
- Art bill: one tier per Wonder per band (**OQ-57**).

## 6. The shape of the ladder

```
cost(L)   = wonder.cost_base × wonder.cost_growth ^ L      Gold
effect(L) = wonder.effect_per_level × L
```

Two lines, three numbers. The numbers live in the game data (**OQ-58**); the
shape is fixed here.

### 6.1 Exponential cost, linear effect

- `costGrowth` is the strongest dial in the feature — the analogue of
  `tap.workSeconds`. It decides whether a Wonder is a sink or a formality.
- Cost compounds; effect does not. The marginal level gets worse forever.
- A Wonder is a place to park a surplus, never a Gold investment.
- A production Wonder's payback is `cost(L)` over a linear return, which
  grows without bound. Whether early levels sit on the wrong side of that
  line is a number (**OQ-58**).

### 6.2 An unbounded effect

- Every reward in this game is priced in a duration of the player's own
  production (a tap pays seconds of work; a Survey chest pays hours of
  production), so doubling output doubles both sides and nothing is trivialised.
- Exceptions priced in absolute Gold: the fog, the technology tree, the
  landmark claims. A deep Wonder trivialises them. Acceptable because all three
  are one-time and bought long before a Wonder is deep; eras re-pricing the
  tree is the answer ([`07-research.md`](07-research.md) §1).
- Anything absolute-priced added after Wonders exist must answer this section.

## 7. Mechanism

1. **`maxLevel` stops being a wall.** A Wonder's `maxLevel` is absent, not a
   big number.
2. **Per-level tables are empty for a Wonder** — no population, workers, army
   cap or per-level tech gate. `requiredTechPerLevel` in particular: a Wonder
   is gated once, at unlock.
3. **The level is a number.** The district card already writes `Lv N` with
   no denominator; a Wonder adds the next level's price.
4. **The purchase is an instant upgrade, not a construction** (§4): pay,
   increment, done, no queue item.

Shared with every building: placement, footprint, moving, art.

### 7.1 One stat per Wonder

| Wonder | Stat | The number it moves |
|---|---|---|
| The Everspring | `cellRecovery` | how fast harvested ground regrows |
| The Astral Spire | `manaRegen` | Mana regeneration |
| The Bell of Toil | `workerYield` | what a crew's strike yields |

- Cost shape: one entry plus one place where the stat is read, as for a
  modifier stat. The stat existing guarantees that place exists.
- This bounds the set: a fourth Wonder is an entry and a line; a tenth is ten
  lines across the sim. Ten Wonders is not ten entries of data (OQ-6, OQ-57).
- Resolution order: base → the completed technologies → modifier stack. **A
  Wonder level belongs to the base stage, not the modifier stack** — never a
  synthetic entry on the stack.

## 8. The ground

- A Wonder stands on the province with a footprint deliberately larger than it
  needs (§5.1), and the ground is the half of its price that is not Gold.
- The plot is not bounded, so that ground is not
  scarce in itself: what a big footprint costs is **the fog that revealed it**
  and the **adjacency** it displaces ([`03-economy.md`](03-economy.md) §3.1).

## 9. What the player sees

Tapping a Wonder opens the district card, like any other building. The card
differs in three ways:

1. **The level as a number** — `Lv 27`, with no `/5` denominator.
2. **The next level's price, always shown**, even when unaffordable. It is
   information on the card, not a priced refusal
   ([`06-construction.md`](06-construction.md)).
3. **What the next level adds**, in the same words as the current effect, so
   the flattening (§6.1) is visible.

- No progress bar, no timer, no *ready to collect* (§4).
- A Wonder never generates a notification, never glows, and never asks for
  anything.

## 10. Dials, in the order to reach for them

| Dial | Value | Key |
|---|---|---|
| Cost growth — sink or formality (§6) | unset (**OQ-58**) | `wonder.costGrowth` |
| Cost base — where level 1 lands relative to a building | unset (**OQ-58**) | `wonder.costBase` |
| Effect per level, per Wonder — how fast the ladder flattens | unset (**OQ-58**) | `wonder.effectPerLevel` |
| Unlock gate — the Townhall level that lists each Wonder (§5.2) | final Townhall level | — |
| Footprint — the non-Gold half of the price (§5.1, §8) | large | — |
| The set — one entry plus one call site each (§7.1) | three | — |

## 11. Acceptance

- A player who has bought every technology and every
  landmark still has a priced thing to spend Gold on, and can see its cost.
- A Wonder level adds no boundary: the replay assertion holds across a Wonder
  purchase during an offline advance.
- No Wonder's effect is denominated in Gold (§3.1), asserted by a test over the
  definitions.
- A second copy cannot be built at any Townhall level (§3.2).
- A deep Wonder renders in the district card without a denominator, with the
  next level's price and what it adds (§9).
- No new wallet row, screen, currency or goal type.

## 12. Deliberately not in this design

- A Wonder that pays Gold (§3.1).
- A second copy of a Wonder (§3.2).
- A level that goes through the build queue (§4).
- A `maxLevel` set to a large number instead of absent (§7).
- A per-level table of any kind.
- A second currency to feed a Wonder (OQ-6).
- Level stars.
- Workers, residents or an area of influence (§5.1).
- A Wonder that is destroyed, downgraded or lost — promise 1.
- A Wonder-specific screen.
- A notification, a glow or anything that asks for attention (§9).
- Donating to another player's Wonder — [`15-social.md`](15-social.md), if at
  all (**OQ-59**).
- A Wonder that unlocks a mechanic rather than scaling a number.
- Prestige, or spending a Wonder for a permanent bonus.
- Generated orders as the repeating Gold sink ([`12-quests.md`](12-quests.md)
  §5).

**Open questions:** **OQ-57**, **OQ-58**, **OQ-59**.
