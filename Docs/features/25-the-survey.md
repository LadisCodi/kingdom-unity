# 25 · The Survey — a ladder that pays for exploring

> **Scope.** The kingdom's **Survey**: one ladder over the whole province,
> climbed by the cells revealed, with a free column and a paid one. It is what
> the game sells of its column, the treasure hunt in the fog
> ([`../overview.md`](../overview.md) § *The fantasies*). It is the game's
> only reward ladder.
>
> **Status: designed; built in the web prototype**, but for the seal that
> flies to the pill (§4).

## 1. Shape

- **One ladder for the whole province**: its levels sit at counts of revealed
  cells, the last at the province bought out.
- **Two columns**, free and paid. The paid column is one purchase, `Survey`,
  **$9.99, once per kingdom**.
- **It never resets and never expires.** A level reached stays reached.

## 2. What climbs it

- **Every revealed cell of the province counts**, whatever revealed it: a tap,
  a building's ground, a claim.
- The count only rises: a revealed cell never goes back to fog.
- Cells of a temporary province ([`13-events.md`](13-events.md) §2.3) and
  hexes of the world map do not count.
- **Nothing else climbs it.** No level is ever sold, and nothing skips one.

## 3. The ladder

**36 levels**, dense at the start and spread out where the fog is dear:

| Levels | Cells revealed |
|---|---|
| 1–9 | every 10, from 20 to 100 |
| 10–19 | every 20, to 300 |
| 20–29 | every 50, to 800 |
| 30–35 | every 100, to 1,400 |
| **36** | **the whole province** |

- **Every cell of both columns pays something.** No rung is empty.
- **Two prizes a cell**, which is what a cell shows.
- The free purse follows the house rule: **minutes of the kingdom's own Gold
  production**, floored, priced when it is claimed.

| Column | Pays |
|---|---|
| Free | a purse of Gold (3 → 20 minutes up the ladder) and, on about one level in three, one more: a relic fragment, a gold key, Knowledge, a silver key or a Bag item |
| Paid | Gems, rising, and one more: a gold key every third level, silver keys, Hero XP, Stardust or a choice chest. **Never relic fragments**: those come only from the free column, and from exploring and fighting |
| **Level 36** | the grand prize: 500 Gems and a gold key free; 10,000 Gems and five gold keys paid |

## 4. Claiming

- **Every cell is its own claim**, out of order, at the player's pace; no
  claim-all.
- **Buying the Survey opens every level already reached**: a column of cells
  to tap, not a payout.
- **A level reached is a moment on the map**: the reveal that crosses it
  sends a small seal from the cell to the Survey's pill *(not built)*; the
  pill glows while a cell waits.
- The free column's fragments are rolled onto the relics as they land ([`09-relics.md`](09-relics.md)).
- Hero XP lands with the bonuses every Hero XP gets (the Tavern, the tree).

## 5. The door

- **The Survey opens with the Store**, when the Townhall reaches level 2
  ([`22-progression.md`](22-progression.md) §3). Its pill appears on the map
  with the levels the kingdom has already reached waiting in it.
- Its introduction is Isolde's ([`23-tutorials.md`](23-tutorials.md) §4.1).

## 6. The screen

- **A full-screen ledger**: the whole width and height under the header; only
  the ladder scrolls.
- **The title band** carries a brass compass at its left end.
- **The province**, on a strip of surveyor's map: the level's blue seal, the
  gold trough to the next level, the next level's cream seal, and the cells
  revealed out of the whole.
- **Two column heads**: *Free* on wood; *Royal Survey* on gold, carrying
  **Buy** with the price on its face while the Survey is unbought.
- **The ladder**: a rope down the middle threading one wax seal a level —
  green when nothing on it waits, gold while something does, cream ahead.
  Left of it the free tile (parchment), right the paid tile (gilded).
- A tile holds at most two rewards, each at the header coin's size. It is a
  button exactly when it can be taken: then it glows gold and carries the
  orb. Taken, it is dimmed and ticked; unbought, it carries a padlock.
- **The grand prize** — the top level — is pinned under the ladder, with its
  chest.
- **The widget on the map**: a parchment card with the compass (the count of
  levels waiting on its rim), *Survey*, the trough and the level's seal; it
  glows while a level waits, and sits under the Knowledge tab.

## 7. Dials, in the order to reach for them

| Dial | Value | Key |
|---|---|---|
| The levels, in cells revealed | §3 | `survey.cells` |
| What each level pays, both columns | §3 | `survey` › `free*`, `paid*` |
| The free purse's floor | 5 Gold a minute | `survey.goldFloorPerMinute` |
| The paid column's price | **$9.99** | `store` › `Survey` |

## 8. Deliberately not in this design

- **A season.** The province is finite and its fog dearer every ring; a reset
  would slow the ladder exactly when the player plays most.
- **A level for sale**, a reveal for sale, or anything that climbs it but
  revealing.
- **Instant reveals as a product**: the Survey sells
  what exploring finds, never a way round exploring.
- A second paid tier above the paid column.
- Counting the world map or a temporary province.
